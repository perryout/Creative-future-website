                To design for humans, you need to understand humans. <br><br>
                As already mentioned, people intrigue me, and I often observe and wonder why people do what they do. <br><br>
                Let's be honest, lately, the world has been crazy. We have been forced globally to repress our primary needs of social nature throughout almost a year of lockdown, we saw attacks on democracies, the fall of governments, we saw protests for justice and equality transmuted into violence and repression, and we put our hope into science helpless, powerless. <br><br>
                But what is the common between those events if not -People-? <br><br>
                Through a brief introduction to classic and contemporary social psychology, covering topics such as decision making, persuasion, group behaviour, personal attraction, and factors that promote health and well-being, this course helped me to find new answers when it comes to human behaviour, opening for me new perspectives and ideas about my future career. <br><br><br>
                What is Social Psychology? <br><br>
                Human beings are "social animals‚Äù (Aristotele, 350 B.C.E), and as such respond to immediate contexts. <br><br>
                Social Psychology is the scientific study of the behaviour of individuals in their social and cultural setting. It examines how people affect one another, how social environments, and the power of situations can influence and shape our behaviour. On how society responds with a change of behaviour in order to align with the social situation at hand, for example, what might have triggered the minds of Nazi German society, or the global philanthropic actions following a tsunami. <br><br>
                Social Psychologists study topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. The firsts pertain to the individual and include emotions, attitudes, the self-concept (who am I?), and the social self (the roles we play, social comparison, self-judgment, self in action, and culture). Interpersonal topics instead pertain to dyads and groups and include group dynamics and processes, intergroup relationships, helping behaviour, aggression, discrimination, prejudice, and attraction. (Myers, 2012; Jhangiani & Tarry, 2014; CNX Psychology, 2014) <br><br>
                This course cleverly presented many and different concepts, theories, and experiments developed in the field of Social Psychology. Particularly I have been fascinated by Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment (1971) which investigated the psychological effects of perceived power, and Darley, J. M., and Batson, C.D. study "From Jerusalem to Jericho" (1973) about the inconsistency between attitudes and behaviour in everyday life. (Find links below) <br><br>
                The first was inspired by Milgram's obedience experiment (1965) and aims to investigate further the impact of situational variables on human behaviour. The experimenter was indeed looking for explanations about the atrocities committed in the Shoah, demonstrating the powerful role that the situation can play in human behaviour. <br><br>
                The second instead, looked into a different variable: time. Proving that thinking about the norms does not imply that one will act on them. And this made me think about modern behaviour concerning the environment, poverty, or animal cruelty. We all know what we have to do, we know the parables, but our actions not always correspond. <br><br><br>
                What did it mean for me? <br><br>
                All this insightful and knowledgeable material also made me reflect on myself and my environment as a sort of auto-analysis both in intra- and interpersonal levels. <br><br>
                Albeit always being intrigued, I had never studied psychology before this experience, and I am really glad I did it. <br><br>
                This course made me reflect on many aspects of my life and society. Making me look at both as two inseparable elements. The content of this course was really insightful and universal. Something that I believe if we all acknowledge, could truly help to build a more understanding and emphatic society. <br><br>
                I promise myself to keep adopting these teaching and deepen even further with other courses and reading. After this course, I could easily see myself following a master's program in consumer behaviour after this study. <br><br>
