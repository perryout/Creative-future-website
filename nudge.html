            <p>
                This is a book review from Matilde Brambilla about: NUDGE by R.H. Thaler & C.R. Sustain, 2008 <br><br>
                •	Objective: Improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness<br>
                •	Main topics: Research in psychology, behavioral economics, libertarian paternalism, and active engineering of choice architecture<br><br>
                What is about: <br><br>
                This book gives an eyes opening about how humans are susceptible not only by their peers or society but also from the way options are presented to them. Nudge is about how we make choices- from how we save money for a pension fund, education, health, or environment - and it presents many examples of how institutions and organizations followed the movement of Libertarian Paternalism. <br><br>
                Libertarian Paternalism encourages companies to use purposeful "choice architecture", alias the way choices are structured and presented, in order to "nudge" people towards the most beneficial one. In substance, Thaler and Sustain support the idea of giving people the full cast of choices, including the liberty of making mistakes, but while introducing a default choice that may at the end result as the most favorable option. <br><br>
                Based on scientific research, the authors describe the development of economics and institutions and their relationship with their users. If in the past, when researching into human decision-making, humans were treated as "Econs" - fantastical beings with incredible powers of perception and self-awareness who infallibly make the best decisions for themselves. Nowadays, behavioral economics takes into consideration the "Human" element, which characterizes people as being irrational beings, prone to mistakes, complex, lazy, and victim of social influence. <br><br>
                In the real world, in fact, people often do not have time, knowledge, and/or motivation to find the best solutions. And consequently, we often choose poorly and are all susceptible to different biases. Nudges are supposed to help us through decision-making while strengthening our reactive system (intellectual conscious) and overpower the automatic system (subconscious, emotional). <br><br>
                Overall opinion: 3/5<br><br>
                If I have to be honest, this book did not correspond to my expectations. I often found it hard to understand, especially because all the examples mentioned relate to the systems present in the USA, which are much different from the European reality I live in.  <br><br>
                It did not really help me with incredible insights or instructions about how to approach the project, however, I found its central concepts of human-centered choice architecture interesting and worthy of reflection. This in fact made me not forget to think about the fact that we are finally designing for people, therefore we need to make something for “Humans”, with their no-time, stress and lack of motivation. <br><br>
                Nudge is the kind of book I will come back to in the future, when maybe with more experience and knowledge, i’ll be able to catch all its interpretation and meanings. <br><br>
