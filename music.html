                <strong>By Dexter Masman</strong> <br><br><br><br>

                <p>
                For my deep dive, I wanted to read studies on what music does to people, especially what positive influence it has. Until one day, my nephew came in while I was making music and asked what I was doing and if he could join in. I showed him how to make beats and let him play on my keyboard and drum pad. He liked it so much that he immediately asked my uncle if he could have a keyboard at home too. I asked my nephew, who is still in primary school, if he gets any music lessons at school, to which he replied that he rarely gets any. I have two other nephews who are also at primary school and they hardly get any music lessons either. I know from my own experience that I rarely had music lessons either, but that the times we did have them I enjoyed them immensely, as I still have memories of them. This gave me the idea of doing research on why music lessons are almost non-existent and reading articles on the benefits of music for children.  <br><br>
The concepts of our class were mainly aimed at adults and not at the children of these people who will be living in the Sluisbuurt. How cool would it be if the Sluisbuurt had its own music building (lab) where space is given to develop talent. Unfortunately, my minor has already ended so I can't make a concept of it myself. <br><br>
Primary school teachers (often) do not see the importance of music education. Many Dutch schools are cutting back on subjects that are not tested, and music lessons are one of them (Onderwijsvanmorgen, 2018). Teachers’ self-efficacy is an important factor that affects students’ learning quality. However, in music classes, many generalist teachers feel incompetent and insecure about primary school music teaching (Klootwijk, 2016). This causes music lessons to deteriorate in both quality and quantity.  <br><br>
Music lessons are less and less followed and given, less practice is taken at home, and also the period in which a child is playing a musical instrument is getting shorter. Primary school teachers have so many tasks and other important subjects that music education is often overlooked. In addition, teachers often do not see themselves as competent enough to teach music well (Klootwijk, 2016). This uncertainty in teachers is mainly due to the training (PABO) they follow to eventually become teachers. In this course, teachers are not taught much about music knowledge or about teaching music to pupils (Anja van den Broek, 2019). Teachers' sense of competence makes an important contribution to the quality of learning among students. <br><br>
The language, music, art and literature that accompany us throughout our lives are vital to our mental health and to provide our sense of self. Culture has inherent value to society. When creative subjects are taught in schools, our entire society and economy will benefit (Incorporated Society of Musicians, 2019). Taking music lessons is important for children to shape themselves culturally and creatively. Research has shown that many benefits of music education include student’s academic success. Little time is spent on music in regular schools (Onderwijs van Morgen, 2018), which makes music schools very important so that enough music teachers can continue existing.  <br><br>
The listed benefits of music education are to improve: your language skills, improved test scores, selfesteem, listening skills, math skills, relieving stress, creativity and higher graduation rates (Barnes, 2015). <br><br><br>
 
<strong>Boost for self-confidence</strong>  <br><br>
Music lessons have many benefits for children. Many studies show that children who participate in music lessons boost their self-esteem and confidence. Helping them not only appreciate praise and enjoying improvement but to accept the criticism and feedback necessary to make progress (Barnes, 2015). Also, music teaching bolsters brain power. A great example of this is Albert Einstein, who was not only a revolutionary physicist, but a master violinist as well. Scientists claim that his devotion to playing music gave him connectivity between the two hemispheres of his brain, the source of creativity and logic, which allowed his brilliance to prosper (Musical-u, 2017) <br><br>

<strong>Cognitive development</strong>  <br><br>
Music lessons can also play a role in the development of children’s cognitive abilities. A research from Dr Jaschke showed that children who received music lessons improved on language-based reasoning and the ability to plan, organize and complete tasks, as well as overall improved academic achievement (Jaschke, 2018). The research proofs that cognitive skills developed in music classes can influence children’s cognitive skills in completely unrelated subjects. This can result in better grades and overall school achievements. Another research shows that children who do musical training before the age of nine, which is a critical developmental period, and keep doing this for ten years or more get great benefits out of it for the rest of their lives (Cole, D., 2014). Music lessons also lead to better behavior because in order to learn music, you need discipline and it requires a lot of practice and dedication (Educationbusiness, 2019). <br><br><br>
 
<strong>Boost for socio-emotional development</strong>  <br><br>
Furthermore, music lessons can be a boost for socio-emotional development. Research has shown that music lessons improved social cohesion among classmates as well as easier adjustment and positive attitudes in children. Learning music in groups fosters greater trust and cooperation. It also challenges children to watch pupils around them for subtle cues to timing, volume and expressiveness, which are the same cues we use for reading expressions and moods on people’s faces. Being able to perceive and understand people’s feelings is a basis for empathy and moral development (Musictogether, 2019). Learning music individually alleviates boredom, loneliness and tension by distracting children from their problems. Playing music is a great mood regulator while at the same time fosters a sense of community and belonging. <br><br><br>
 
<strong>Improving memory</strong>  <br><br>
Science shows that music lessons can positively change brain structure and function. When started at a young age with music lessons, it can also lead to better brain development and long-term memory (Rampton, 2017) <br><br><br>
 
<strong>Music effects the mood</strong>  <br><br>
Music is a good way to change your mood, and therefore your behavior. Several studies show that people are unconsciously able to shift their focus as soon as music is turned on. For example, people who are in a bad mood can leave this bad mood behind by listening to cheerful music (Schafer, 2013). But, this also works the other way around. Music can also evoke negative feelings in a person. For example, if it contains music that this person does not like, the mood in which he/she is in the wrong mood can also change. But in general music evokes positive feelings. Whether someone makes music themselves or just listens to it, music has a demonstrably positive effect on the brain. Music can reduce stress, improve mood, and release feelings and memories. In addition, it relaxes and lowers blood pressure. <br><br><br>
 
 
<strong>Stimulating behavior with music</strong>  <br><br>
The research by Hallam showed that group teachers in primary education succeeded in stimulating positive behaviour by playing background music during math lessons. Pupils from these classes often showed disruptive behavior during math lessons, which was described in this research as being busy, aggressive, and busy with someone else instead of focusing on themselves. The results of these students turned out to be below the average of surrounding schools. After a period in which calm background music was switched on during math lessons, the results of the math tests appeared to improve, as did the results for disruptive behavior. Higher grades were obtained, and the degree of disruptive behavior decreased (Hallam, 2002). <br><br>
For writing this article, I have read various scientific studies and articles. In the source list below you can see which ones.  <br>
It is clear that music has an enormous positive influence on people, especially when you start doing it at a young age. That is why it is so important that more initiatives are taken to get children in touch with music.
