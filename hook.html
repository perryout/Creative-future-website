                <strong>HOOKED by N. Eyal, 2014 </strong> <br><br>
                        Objective: How to build habit-forming products<br><br>

                        Main topics: Hook model, consumer behavior, marketing, user habits, design, positioning steps<br><br>


                        If you ever wondered what makes people constantly come back to Instagram, Twitter, World of Warcraft, or Ikea, this book has the answer! <br><br>

                        Hooked is a well structured and easy-reading book that describes the psychology behind what drives consumer behavior in a sea of competitive choices. The winning secret of these companies is explained by the idea of the Hook Model and its four-step process: Trigger - Action - Variable reward - Investment. that when embedded into products, subtly encourages customer behavior. <br><br>
                        <br>
                        The steps: <br>

                        •	The Trigger is what attracts the attention of the user. It can be external (ex: advertisement) or internal (responding to a need of emotion). Truly addictive products use in fact the latter, becoming omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. The trigger emotions are also usually negative and play with the subconscious. For example, people use Instagram or Snapchat to resolve their "fear of missing out", Facebook or Pinterest to defeat their boredom or loneliness, but without ever tackling this function to the audience. <br><br>
                        •	Action: "It is important to remember that a habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought" (p.61), therefore actions need to be as simplistic as possible. An example is Twitter, simple software and easy to use. The author introduces the theory and Behavior Model of Dr.B.J.Fogg and its formula B=MAT, representing that a given behavior occurs when motivation, ability, and trigger are present at the same time and on sufficient degrees (see link below). <br><br>
                        •	Variable Reward: the third step of the model underlines the importance of rewarding the users by resolving a problem, and reinforcing their motivation and action previously taken. Having them want to reengage with the product. There are three types of variable rewards: the tribe (social connection and confirmation: Facebook), the hunt (resources and information, ex: Wikipedia), and the self (intrinsic reward, ex: MyFitnessPal). Important is also that the reward is variable, that it changes and keeps surprising the users. With Pinterest you never know what content you will find, still, you keep scrolling. <br><br>
                        •	Investment: "the more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it." (p.138). there is ample evidence to suggest that we irrationally value our efforts. It has been proved that 1. the more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it; we are more likely to be consistent with our past behaviors, and we change our preferences to avoid cognitive dissonance*. An example ane is called the IKEA effect, for which, as a matter of fact, consumers invest in the products through their labor.
